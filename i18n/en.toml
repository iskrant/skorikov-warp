artist_bio = """Skorikov Igor Andreevich is a painter, a member of the Russian Union of Artists. He acquired his first skills in fine arts while studying at the Ostrogozhsk Art School named after I. N. Kramskoy. Subsequently, he received a higher art and pedagogical education (KSU). He continued his creative activity and studies in St. Petersburg (1984 -1998), attended drawing classes and private studios. He currently lives and works in Voronezh. He is a constant participant in regional, all-Russian, and international exhibitions of the Russian Union of Artists, and has held several personal exhibitions. His works are in museum and private collections in Russia and other countries.
"Igor Skorikov works in a realistic manner; he is inspired by the art of old masters, with its inherent unhurried rhythm and deep contemplation. His painting is complex, glazing, avoiding flashy external effects and expressive dynamics. Time in his paintings seems to slow down, allowing one to consciously live through minutes and hours, 'passing' them through oneself. The object, as an event, arises in contrast to emptiness, emerging from the flow of forms and time.
The artist's favorite genre is still life – a genre that allows for an abstract, philosophical view of the world, time, nature, and human life. The choice of subjects is never accidental; by building an imaginative system, the artist speaks about the world, about time, about life. Each painting is a reflection through contemplation, sometimes filled with tragic notes. The main characters of the still lifes – objects – have lost their bright luster, accumulated dents and scratches, acquiring a biography. Compositions are built into mises-en-scènes, unfolding stories of human existence.
Having passed the seduction of 'realism' in depiction and simple viewing, the attentive viewer plunges into their own experiences and contemplation." © Natalia Bakina, art critic."""
